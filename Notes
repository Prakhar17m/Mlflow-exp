# Mlflow
mlflow use to control models , make them in decipline

if we have 10 modes which we run them 50 runs and after 5 days
we want to know which model performs best

- we will go to jupyter nootbook and check but it will take so much time
- here comes mlflow it is a system that remembers everything about your ml model experements automatically


- before mlflow
   -- the experiments are scattered and stored in the notebooks like jupyter
   -- no history of what worked
   -- can not reproduce the results
   -- no idea which model is deployed
   -- no rollback in production model fails

- after mlflow  --mlflow tracks
   -- which data is used
   -- which parameters and metrices are used
   -- which model fits and belongs to which experiments
   -- google drive + excel + git

- traditional way
   -- excel, nootbook
   -- manual
   -- file naming convention
   -- manual accounting
   --problem--humans error, not scalable, not collaborative , not production safe

- mlfow automatically
   -- saves experiments
   -- store the experiments and metrices 
   -- keeps model versions
   -- shows comperison UI
   -- all the process were automated


# Mlflow architecture
- mlflow manages the full journey of a ml model from the experiments to the production level
- manage the models journey with 4 parts
  1. mlflow tracking
      -- diary of experiments 
      -- tracks the models and store the paraments and metrices used 
      -- store artifacts
  2. mlflow projects
      -- it is like the reciepe book
      -- ensures that we have the same version , same liberary and extentions 
  3. mlflow models
      -- it isi like the packing the dish
      -- packs the train model & can be load and predict
  4. mlflow registery model
      -- here we works on the QA
      -- keeps different versions of our model 
      -- and also keep delopment control
        dev--> staging-->production
        idea-->dish--->exper-->dish-->recipe--->kitchen-->packing-->QA
- ml experiments are store,  and ensure that our exp will work properly independent if machine or system , then after that we can make our model deployemnt ready , at last stage we do QA deployment controlling

---track----reprode---pack----approval
 
# Use cases
 -tracking experiments
 -compare model
 -improve accuracy
 -register best model
 -version model
 -load model in api
 -automate pipeline
 -control deployments 
 -rollback bad models
